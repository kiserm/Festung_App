# Festung_App
This is an application for the Nidwaldner Museum for Android as well as for iOS.

It was developped for a exhibition of the nidwaldner museum. The idea was that 
families with their kids or other visitors could experience the museum in a 
digital and interactive modern way.

The tool I used to develop this app was React Native with Expo. It was a 
pleasure to code, because with the Expo App I could have a live coding experience
where I saw changes in code immediately on the devices. Only the deployment is a bit
tricky, because you can not build an ios standalone .ipa file without having the apple
developper account which costs you 100 USD per year! On Android the build works fine 
and you can build your .apk file for free!
